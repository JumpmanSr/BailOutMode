///// Latest Updates:

4-28-2020 - Update time :)

3-24-2020: Hello, this should still work on 1.8.0 (at leaat I have not heard any complaints yet). There is a pending update so if that happens, during these corona times I'll update it. 

1-3-2020: - 10:48 PM: Hello, due to some weird changes in the game, some things did not work the same as before. Those issues have been resolved and a beta version will be releasing within a few minutes. I have to re-add ingame toggles but I just don't feel like doing that tonight.

12-27-2019 - 4:28 AM: Hi, I didn't realize this was broken. I have fixed core functionality. Just need to fix the extra bits (hiding health bar, and maybe ingame toggles) but expect an update either later today 12-27 or 12-28, ty for ur patience.

11-26-19: 1.69.69 Released, BS 1.5.0 Compatible.

11-23-2019: Putting finishing touches on update. Current version is still 1.5.0 compatible (Update BS_UTILS & CUSTOM UI)

8-29-2019: Updated for BeatSaber 1.3.0

Only known issue:

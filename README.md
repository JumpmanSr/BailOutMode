# BailOutMode
A Plugin that will prevent you from failing, and instead switches game modes to No Fail.

I want to stress that the original idea and code was done by FoolishDave, I meerly updated this to work with the latest BeatSaber version and I might keep this up to date.

Only known issue:
If you "BailOut" but then don't finish the song, the plugin will not work until you finish/fail a song again then will resume working.
This is an unfortunate bug of my method used to fix the plugin, I might fix it later.

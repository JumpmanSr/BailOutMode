# BailOutMode
A Plugin that will prevent you from failing, and instead switches game modes to No Fail.

I want to stress that the original idea and code was done by FoolishDave, I meerly updated this to work with the latest BeatSaber version and I might keep this up to date.

Only known issue:
None for now.
